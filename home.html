                    <h3>Why Melons?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Well the thing about melons is that they are amazing, and you can't deny that! Furthermore, they come in many
                        different colors AND many different flavors. Who couldn't love that variety? They are healthy, sweet, and 
                        quenching—perfect for a healthy dessert, a hot afternoon, or really any time, day or night, rain or shine.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Now That's Some Water for Ya</h3>

                    <p>
                        Did you know over half of our bodies are made up of water? It's pretty crazy, but that just goes to show how important
                        water is for us. Well, guess what else has an even GREATER water ratio than us? Watermelons!! This juicy, delicious fruit
                        is not made up of 60%, not 70%, but <b>92%</b> water! Yeah, you heard me right.<br>
                        ...<br>
                        What? You don't have any watermelon?
                        Go get some you dehydrated, unhealthy fool!
                    </p>
                                
                    <h3>The Secret of Watermelon</h3>

                    <p>
                        I know, I know. There's no way they could possibly get better, right?? Well, don't lose your rind, but they absolutely can!
                        If you've already had one, then you should know by now, but if not... what are you doing still here?? Go get one now!!
                        Anyway, all the melons are good—canteloupe, muskmelon/honeydew, watermelon—but none of them compare to watermelon. Now,
                        this IS personal preference, but I must explain. Watermelon has that CRUNCH, and a higher water ratio than any of them.
                        It's delicious, full of water, and yep, you heard it, CRUNCHY. Bet you didn't know it had that crunch, huh? Well, now you
                        know the secret of watermelon :)
